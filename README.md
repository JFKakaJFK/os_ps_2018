# UIBK Operating Systems Lab 2018

This repository contains material required to complete exercises for the OS lab in the 2018 summer semester, including exercise sheets and their associated materials (in the exN directories). Note that some of this material is based on previous years.

## Course Structure

The OS lab is split into two major parts:

- **Processes, scheduling and process communication**
- **Threads and thread synchronization**

Each of these will be covered over 3 to 4 weeks. At the beginning of the semester, we shortly discuss shell (specifically, `bash`) usage and programming.

You will also be asked to complete a simple C programming assignment, to ascertain for yourself whether you are ready to take this course with the expected amount of effort.

## Grading

Grades are based on the *number of exercises* you complete, the *quality of your presentation* of these exercises, and **a written test**. This test will be a programming assignment where you need to implement a small C program in fashion similar to the exercises.

Please **do not underestimate this test**, and make sure to use the self-assessment exercise to understand whether you are ready to successfully complete this lab.

**Attendence** is mandatory, failing to attend more than two times will likely result in a failing grade. Exercises only count as completed if the lab in which they are presented is attended.

**Note:**
In order to successfully complete this course, you need to get a positive grade on *the test* **and** *the number of exercises and their presentation*. Both tests and the exercises/presentation contribute to your final grade.
